As an Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Member, I have a deep understanding of the accounting profession and a passion for staying up-to-date with the latest accounting standards. However, I also love a good challenge and have pivoted my career towards a more technological role.

I've been focused on understanding the full range of technologies used in everyday applications, with a particular emphasis on data, both real-time and static. I find it incredibly satisfying to use my skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions that improve their bottom line.

I'm always eager to learn new things and stay ahead of the curve in my field. As such, I'm constantly exploring new technologies, frameworks, and tools that can help me do my job more effectively.

I'm excited to see how the worlds of accounting and technology continue to intersect and evolve, and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of these changes. If you're looking for a detail-oriented and tech-savvy professional who can help take your organization to the next level, please don't hesitate to reach out.
